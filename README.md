# LL mod: Unsupervised paper
This repository is based on a snapshot of the [LogLead](https://github.com/EvoTestOps/LogLead) tool. Please see the full tool for more details including the download links for datasets.

This version is only intended to work as a replication package for the paper [Speed and Performance of Parserless and Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Methods
on Software Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01934) (link is preprint). This version has reduced functionality but also some specific additions we didn't want to include in the general tool.
